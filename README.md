# Chicago-Traffic-Crash-Analysis-using-SAS

This project examines traffic crashes in Chicago from 2016 to 2023 using SAS, analyzing data from the Chicago Police Department with over 750,000 records. The study investigates factors influencing accident rates, such as speed limits, lighting, weather, and roadway conditions, with a focus on identifying patterns and seasonal trends. Key findings challenge assumptions, showing moderate-speed areas (around 30-55 mph) and environmental conditions, such as wet or icy roads, as significant contributors to severe incidents. 

Visualizations, including bar and mosaic plots, reveal accident frequency and severity across different times, days, and seasons. These insights highlight the importance of tailored safety measures, providing a comprehensive perspective on road safety in Chicago.
